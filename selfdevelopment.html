    <p align="justify"> This research comes at a time of concern of student mental health. Suicide rates in UK universities have never been higher and there has been a fivefold increase in student disclosure of mental health problems in a decade (BBC). A 2017 IPPR survey found that 94% of higher education providers experienced a rise in demand for counselling services in the past five years and 61% reported a rise in demand of more than 25%. The same survey reports that at some universities one in four students is using or waiting to use counselling services. Various reasons for this trend has been put forward, including this generation of undergraduates experiencing.  The report makes several recommendations including to spend more money on student mental health services and to obtain better data on which interventions most improve student mental health services. However, these recommendations seem to miss the point about preventing students becoming in need of such services in the first place. Sir Anthony Seldon, former Master of Wellington College and current (2018) vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham commented:</p>
    <p align="left" class="content-student">Student suicide rates and emotional distress levels could be reduced at university if we acted differently. We are obsessed by reactive policy once students hit the bottom of the waterfall; we need to be putting preventative policies in place to prevent them ever tipping over the edge.</p>
    <p align="left">Thus a coaching study is timely, in that coaching may well be one such preventative measure that can be put in place and offered to students, as a way to nip in the bud issues that could develop in mental health problems. </p>
